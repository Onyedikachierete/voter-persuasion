# Abstract
The study seeks to predict votersâ€™ persuasion towards a particular direction. The data set explored was voter persuasion which was downloaded from the Kaggle website. The data is made up of 10,000 rows and 79 columns which are the variable set. Multicollinearity was used to select the most accurate variables to carry out the classification. Two models were created using machine learning algorithms and these were the Light Gradient Boosted Machine Classifier and the Decision Tree Classifier. The findings obtained by both models were highly outstanding, and they illustrate their capacity to classify whether or not a voter is likely to switch their vote. The LGBM classifier gave a higher AUC score and thus, it was the best fit model for classification as it showed that NH_WHITE was the best predictor for movement in the direction of voters.
